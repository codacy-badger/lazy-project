# DotEnv

DotEnv is a tool that allow us to create a __.env__ file with the same global variables that we are going to define in the server (NAME=VALUE pairs). The idea is to have a replicated environment while developing, being sure that we are going to have the same variables once we deploy our app in the server.

```js
MY_STRING=string
MY_NUMBER=123456
MY_BOOLEAN=true
```
