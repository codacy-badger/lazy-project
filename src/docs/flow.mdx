# Flow

Flow is Facebook's typing tool for JavaScript. It's pretty similar to other typing tools and it uses a babel plugin to remove type annotations while transpiling the files.

```bash
npm install --save-dev flow-bin
```

You have in other sections how to install it for Babel and ESLint.

Finally we add a script to run it when testing:

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test:flow",
    "test:flow": "flow"
  }
}
```

To start working with Flow, first we need to init it.

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/flow 'init'
```

By default you need to add this line at the beginning of the document to tell Flow to check it: `// @flow`.
