# React

To use React in our project we need to install two libraries: __React__ and __ReactDOM__.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

The project has two main files.

* __index.jsx__ ➞ where we add the needed code to start our React application using the entry component.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

import App from './app.jsx';

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

* __app.jsx__ ➞ where we have our entry component, and the hot reaload entry point.

```jsx
import './app.scss';

import React from 'react';
import { hot } from 'react-hot-loader/root';

const App = () => <h1>Hello World!</h1>;

export default hot(App);
```

## ☣️ Warning

* Use always __JSX__ extension for React files. It will be an error if there is jsx code inside a normal __JS__ file when running the test.
