# Jest

Jest is the best testing tool for JavaScript, period. So we are going to use it :)

First we need to install it and Enzyme, the tool from Airbnb to handle React components:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

And then add a script to run it.

```JSON
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "npm run test:jest",
    "test:jest": "jest",
    "test:jest:watch": "jest --watch",
  }
}
```

And generate a basic configuration file:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/jest --init
```

And also a __test-setup.js__ file to define Enzyme's adapter.

```js
// Enzyme.
const Enzyme = require('enzyme');
const Adapter = require('enzyme-adapter-react-16');

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```
