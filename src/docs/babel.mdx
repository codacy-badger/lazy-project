# Babel

To be able to work with React, we need Babel to transpile our project files.

We need to instal Babel core and the Babel presets for ES, React and Flow.

```bash
npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-preset-flow
```

And add the __.babelrc__ configuration file:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-env",
    "@babel/preset-react",
    "@babel/preset-flow"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "react-hot-loader/babel"
  ]
}
```
