# WebPack

WebPack is the core of the project. We are going to use WebPack to develop and build the final release.

We need to install WebPack and the loaders and plugins around it.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
```

## Loaders

* __babel-loader__ ➞ this loaders uses Babel and load JSX and ES files.

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-loader
```

* __style-loader__ and __style-loader__ ➞ these loaders imports CSS styles and inject them inside the JavaScript file that imports them.

```bash
npm install --save-dev style-loader style-loader
```

* __sass-loader__ ➞ this loader allow us to import Sass files.

```bash
npm install --save-dev sass-loader node-sass
```

* __postcss-loader__ ➞ this loader allow us to import CSS files using PostCSS tools to transform them.

```bash
npm install --save-dev postcss-loader
```

* __url-loader__ and __file-loader__ ➞ these two loader has a similar behavior. Both load assets. The difference is that __url-loader__ inject the file inside the code, and __file-loader__ creates a file inside the distribution folder, linked with the code through its name. The __url-loader__ can be configured with a size limit. Files under the limit will be injected, and files over the limit will be linked.

```bash
npm install --save-dev url-loader file-loader
```

## Plugins

WebPack plugins will help us to perform extra activities while developing and building our app. For instance, we will create the `index.html`, and extract the CSS code from the JavaScript files using plugins.

* __mini-css-extract-plugin__ ➞ this plugin will extract the CSS imported code from the JavaScript bundle.

```bash
npm install --save-dev mini-css-extract-plugin
```

* __html-webpack-plugin__ ➞ this plugin will create the index.html for our application every time, linking the new generated JavaScript and CSS bundles, with their new hashes.

```bash
npm install --save-dev html-webpack-plugin
```

## WebPack Dev Server

To start a development server, we are going to install `webpack-dev-server` and `react-hot-loader`, a plugin to allow us to hot reload our application during development.

```bash
npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server react-hot-loader
```
