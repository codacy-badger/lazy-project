# Load State

This is the loader that appears when we are waiting.

We have to types of loaders. The component loading state and the client loading state. The only difference is the color.

The load state for the client is shown when we wait for API responses.

  <LoadStateClient />
</Playground>

The component one is launched when we have lazy loading, and we wait for any part of the application that is not downloaded with the main bundle.

  <LoadStateComponent />
</Playground>
